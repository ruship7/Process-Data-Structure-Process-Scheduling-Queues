# Process-Data-Structure-Process-Scheduling-Queues
# Process Scheduling Simulator

This project simulates process scheduling in an operating system using different algorithms like:
- Round Robin (RR)
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling

### 🛠️ Features
- Simulates process loading, ready queue handling, and execution
- Tracks global time and process status changes
- Displays memory state and queues
- Output logs are written to `output.txt`

### 📁 Files
- `code.cpp` – Main simulation code
- `input.txt` – Input file containing job data
- `output.txt` – Auto-generated log file with process details and memory dump

### 📥 Input Format (input.txt)
Each process should be defined with a control card like:
